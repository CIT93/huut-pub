## First solution: Have 2 separate dropdown, 1 for dishwasher water consumption and one for washing machine. Based on user input, then calculate it.

## Second solution: Only 1 dropdown to receive user input and 1 checkbox which is based on the value of dropdown. In case checkbox is enabled, then calculate twice. Otherwise, not calculate.
